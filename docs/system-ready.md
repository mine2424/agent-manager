- Audit logging system

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality ✅
- Frontend unit tests (123/123 passing)
- Component tests with React Testing Library
- Error boundary implementation
- Mobile-responsive UI
- Comprehensive test utilities

### Phase 4: System Integration ✅
- Environment configuration system
- Automated setup scripts
- System status monitoring
- Health check endpoints
- Development workflow automation

## Quick Start

1. **Access the Application**
   ```bash
   open http://localhost:5173
   ```

2. **Sign In**
   - Click "Sign in with GitHub"
   - Authorize the application
   - You'll be redirected to the dashboard

3. **Create Your First Project**
   - Click "新しいプロジェクト" (New Project)
   - Enter project name and description
   - Click "作成" (Create)

4. **Add Files**
   - Open your project
   - Click "新しいファイル" (New File)
   - Enter file name and content
   - Click "作成" (Create)

5. **Execute Commands**
   - Go to "実行" (Execute) tab
   - Enter a command (e.g., `ls -la`)
   - Click "実行" (Execute)
   - View real-time output

## System Commands

### Start/Stop Services
```bash
# Start all services
./scripts/start-dev.sh

# Check system status
./scripts/status.sh

# Run system tests
./scripts/test-system.sh
```

### Monitor System
```bash
# Check health
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# View audit logs (once generated)
tail -f local-bridge/logs/audit-*.log

# Monitor services
./scripts/status.sh
```

## Configuration Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `frontend/.env.local` | Frontend Firebase configuration |
| `local-bridge/.env` | Backend server configuration |
| `local-bridge/serviceAccount.json` | Firebase Admin SDK (optional) |

## Key Features Ready for Testing

### Authentication & Authorization
- GitHub OAuth login
- JWT token validation
- Session management
- User context throughout app

### Project Management
- Create/Read/Update/Delete projects
- Project listing with real-time updates
- Project detail views
- File association

### File Management
- Create/Read/Update/Delete files
- Syntax highlighting (ready for implementation)
- File tree navigation
- Real-time synchronization

### Command Execution
- Claude CLI integration
- Real-time output streaming
- Error handling
- Command history (ready for implementation)

### Security Features
- Input validation on all forms
- XSS prevention
- SQL injection prevention
- Path traversal protection
- Rate limiting (configurable)
- Audit logging

### UI/UX Features
- Mobile-responsive design
- Error boundaries
- Loading states
- Toast notifications
- Japanese UI labels

## Known Limitations

1. **Firebase Service Account**: Currently using environment variables instead of service account JSON
2. **TypeScript Errors**: Some test files have compilation errors (doesn't affect runtime)
3. **Chunk Size**: Frontend bundle is >500KB (optimization needed)

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Security Hardening**
   - Enable rate limiting
   - Enable audit logging
   - Configure CSP headers
   - Implement HTTPS

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Code splitting for frontend
   - Bundle size optimization
   - Caching strategies
   - Database indexing

3. **Deployment**
   - Firebase Hosting setup
   - CI/CD pipeline
   - Environment-specific configs
   - Monitoring and alerting
